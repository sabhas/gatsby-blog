## What is a HTTP?

HTTP, or Hypertext Transfer Protocol, is a protocol used for communication between web servers and web clients. It is the foundation of data communication for the World Wide Web.

## Different Versions

Over the years, different versions of HTTP have been developed, each with its own features and improvements. In this article, we will discuss the different versions of HTTP and their characteristics.

### HTTP/0.9

HTTP/0.9 was the first version of HTTP, released in 1991. It was a simple protocol with no header information and only one method: GET. It was designed to transfer only plain text and was not suitable for transferring other media types.

### HTTP/1.0

HTTP/1.0 was released in 1996 and introduced many new features, including support for different media types, caching, and the ability to post data to the server. HTTP/1.0 also introduced status codes, which indicate the success or failure of a request. The protocol was designed to be stateless, which means that each request/response cycle is independent of any previous or subsequent cycles.

### HTTP/1.1

HTTP/1.1 was released in 1999 and is still the most widely used version of HTTP today. It introduced several new features, including persistent connections, pipelining, and chunked transfers. Persistent connections allow the client and server to reuse the same connection for multiple requests and responses, which can significantly reduce the latency of each request. Pipelining allows the client to send multiple requests without waiting for each response, which can further reduce latency. Chunked transfers allow the server to send data in smaller chunks, which can be useful for large responses.

### HTTP/2

HTTP/2 was released in 2015 and is a major revision of the protocol. It was designed to address some of the shortcomings of HTTP/1.1 and to improve performance. Some of the key features of HTTP/2 include <a href="https://web.dev/performance-http2/#request-and-response-multiplexing" target="_blank">Multiplexing</a>, server push, and binary framing. Multiplexing allows the client to send multiple requests over the same connection without waiting for each response. Server push allows the server to push resources to the client before the client requests them, which can further reduce latency. Binary framing replaces the text-based framing used in HTTP/1.x with a binary format, which is more efficient and easier to parse.

### HTTP/3

HTTP/3 is the latest version of the protocol and was released in 2020. It is a major revision of HTTP/2 and is designed to address some of the shortcomings of TCP, which is the transport protocol used by HTTP/1.x and HTTP/2. HTTP/3 uses QUIC as its transport protocol, which is a UDP-based protocol that provides faster and more reliable connections. Some of the key features of HTTP/3 include improved congestion control, faster connection establishment, and better security.

HTTP is a crucial protocol for the World Wide Web, and its different versions have played a significant role in shaping the web as we know it today. HTTP/1.x is still widely used, but HTTP/2 and HTTP/3 offer significant performance improvements and better security. As the web continues to evolve, we can expect HTTP to evolve as well, with new versions and features designed to meet the changing needs of web developers and users.
