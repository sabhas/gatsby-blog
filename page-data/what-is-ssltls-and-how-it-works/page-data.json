However, the SSL protocol is currently deprecated. <a href=\"understanding-tls-transport-layer-security\">Transport Layer Security (TLS)</a> is SSL’s successor. TLS was developed by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) and is the correct term that people should start using.</p>\n<h2>How Does SSL/TLS Encryption Work?</h2>\n<p>SSL/TLS uses both asymmetric and symmetric encryption to protect the confidentiality and integrity of data-in-transit. Asymmetric encryption is used to establish a secure session between a client and a server, and symmetric encryption is used to exchange data within the secured session.</p>\n<p>A website must have an SSL/TLS certificate for their web server/domain name to use SSL/TLS encryption. Once installed, the certificate enables the client and server to securely negotiate the level of encryption in the following steps:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The client contacts the server using a secure URL (HTTPS…).</li>\n<li>The server sends the client its certificate and public key.</li>\n<li>The client verifies this with a Trusted Root Certification Authority to ensure the certificate is legitimate.</li>\n<li>The client and server negotiate the strongest type of encryption that each can support.</li>\n<li>The client encrypts a session (secret) key with the server’s public key, and sends it back to the server.</li>\n<li>The server decrypts the client communication with its private key, and the session is established.</li>\n<li>The session key (symmetric encryption) is now used to encrypt and decrypt data transmitted between the client and server.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Both the client and server are now using HTTPS (SSL/TLS + HTTP) for their communication.</p>\n<p>Once you leave the website, those keys are discarded. On your next visit, a new handshake is negotiated, and a new set of keys are generated.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"What is SSL/TLS?
